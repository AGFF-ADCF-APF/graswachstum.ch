# SEO Magic Plugin

The **SEO Magic** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). A **valid SEO Magic License** is required to install and use this plugin.  Please check out the [SEO Magic Premium page](https://getgrav.org/premium/seo-magic) for full details.

## Installation

Installing the Seo Magic plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install seo-magic

This will install the Seo Magic plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/seo-magic`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `seo-magic`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-seo-magic) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/seo-magic
	
> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) to operate.

### Admin Plugin

If you use the admin plugin, you can install directly through the admin plugin by browsing the `Plugins` tab and clicking on the `Add` button.
